 # FAQ
 Q: Can I use this for my bot?<br>A: Yes! You can use this for your bot. I recommend using the entire project. If you only use some parts of the code, please still credit me.
 
 Q: Where do I leave credit and how do I do it?<br>A: If you use the entire project, credit is already given in the `credits.js` file. If you only use some commands, please add credit in a credits command, or in a credits section. To correctly give credit for commands, add the link to this GitHub.
 
 Q: Can I submit code to the bot, instead of making my own?<br>A: Yes! Just fork this project, make your changes, and make your pull request. If we add your code, you will get credit for it.
